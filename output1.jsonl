A relation from A to B defines a relationship between those two sets. A\nfunction is a special type of relation in which each element of the first set is related to exactly one element of the second\nset. The element of the first set is called the input; the element of the second set is called the output. Functions are used all\nthe time in mathematics to describe relationships between two sets. For any function, when we know the input, the output is\ndetermined, so we say that the output is a function of the input. For example, the area of a square is determined by its side\nlength, so we say that the area (the output) is a function of its side length (the input). The velocity of a ball thrown in the\nair can be described as a function of the amount of time the ball is in the air. The cost of mailing a package is a function of\nthe weight of the package. Since functions have so many uses, it is important to have precise definitions and terminology to\nstudy them.\nDefinition\nA function f consists of a set of inputs, a set of outputs, and a rule for assigning each input to exactly one output. The\nset of inputs is called the domain of the function. The set of outputs is called the range of the function.\nFor example, consider the function f,\nwhere the domain is the set of all real numbers and the rule is to square the input.\nThen, the input x = 3 is assigned to the output 32 = 9. Since every nonnegative real number has a real-value square root,\nevery nonnegative number is an element of the range of this function. Since there is no real number with a square that is\nnegative, the negative real numbers are not elements of the range. We conclude that the range is the set of nonnegative real\nnumbers.\nFor a general function f with domain D,\nwe often use x to denote the input and y to denote the output associated with\nx. When doing so, we refer to x as the independent variable and y as the dependent variable, because it depends on x.\nUsing function notation, we write y = f(x),\nand we read this equation as “y equals f of x.” For the squaring function\ndescribed earlier, we write f(x) = x2.\nThe concept of a function can be visualized using Figure 1.2, Figure 1.3, and Figure 1.4.\n8\nChapter 1 | Functions and Graphs\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11964/1.12"}

The graph consists\nof the points (x, f(x)) for all x in the domain.\nEvery function has a domain. However, sometimes a function is described by an equation, as in f(x) = x2,\nwith no\nspecific domain given. In this case, the domain is taken to be the set of all real numbers x for which f(x) is a real number.\nFor example, since any real number can be squared, if no other domain is specified, we consider the domain of f(x) = x2\nto be the set of all real numbers. On the other hand, the square root function f(x) =\nx only gives a real output if x is\nnonnegative. Therefore, the domain of the function f(x) =\nx is the set of nonnegative real numbers, sometimes called the\nnatural domain.\nFor the functions f(x) = x2 and f(x) =\nx,\nthe domains are sets with an infinite number of elements. Clearly we cannot\nlist all these elements. When describing a set with an infinite number of elements, it is often helpful to use set-builder or\ninterval notation. When using set-builder notation to describe a subset of all real numbers, denoted ℝ,\nwe write\n⎧\n⎩\n⎨x|x has some property\n⎫\n⎭\n⎬.\nWe read this as the set of real numbers x such that x has some property. For example, if we were interested in the set of\nreal numbers that are greater than one but less than five, we could denote this set using set-builder notation by writing\n{x|1 < x < 5}.\nA set such as this, which contains all numbers greater than a and less than b,\ncan also be denoted using the interval\nnotation (a, b). Therefore,\n(1, 5) =\n⎧\n⎩\n⎨x|1 < x < 5\n⎫\n⎭\n⎬.\nThe numbers 1 and 5 are called the endpoints of this set. If we want to consider the set that includes the endpoints, we\nwould denote this set by writing\n[1, 5] = {x|1 ≤x ≤5}.\nWe can use similar notation if we want to include one of the endpoints, but not the other. To denote the set of nonnegative\nreal numbers, we would use the set-builder notation\n{x|0 ≤x}.\nThe smallest number in this set is zero, but this set does not have a largest number. Using interval notation, we would use\nthe symbol ∞,\nwhich refers to positive infinity, and we would write the set as\n[0, ∞) = {x|0 ≤x}.\nIt is important to note that ∞is not a real number. It is used symbolically here to indicate that this set includes all real\nnumbers greater than or equal to zero.

Algebraic formulas are important tools to calculate function values. Often we also represent these functions\nvisually in graph form.\nChapter 1 | Functions and Graphs\n15\n\nGiven an algebraic formula for a function f,\nthe graph of f is the set of points\n⎛\n⎝x, f(x)\n⎞\n⎠,\nwhere x is in the domain of\nf and f(x) is in the range. To graph a function given by a formula, it is helpful to begin by using the formula to create\na table of inputs and outputs. If the domain of f consists of an infinite number of values, we cannot list all of them, but\nbecause listing some of the inputs and outputs can be very useful, it is often a good way to begin.\nWhen creating a table of inputs and outputs, we typically check to determine whether zero is an output. Those values of\nx where f(x) = 0 are called the zeros of a function. For example, the zeros of f(x) = x2 −4 are x = ± 2. The zeros\ndetermine where the graph of f intersects the x -axis, which gives us more information about the shape of the graph of\nthe function. The graph of a function may never intersect the x-axis, or it may intersect multiple (or even infinitely many)\ntimes.\nAnother point of interest is the y -intercept, if it exists. The y -intercept is given by\n⎛\n⎝0, f(0)\n⎞\n⎠.\nSince a function has exactly one output for each input, the graph of a function can have, at most, one y -intercept. If x = 0\nis in the domain of a function f,\nthen f has exactly one y -intercept. If x = 0 is not in the domain of f,\nthen f has\nno y -intercept. Similarly, for any real number c,\nif c is in the domain of f,\nthere is exactly one output f(c),\nand the\nline x = c intersects the graph of f exactly once. On the other hand, if c is not in the domain of f, f(c) is not defined\nand the line x = c does not intersect the graph of f. This property is summarized in the vertical line test.\nRule: Vertical Line Test\nGiven a function f, every vertical line that may be drawn intersects the graph of f no more than once. If any vertical\nline intersects a set of points more than once, the set of points does not represent a function.\nWe can use this test to determine whether a set of plotted points represents the graph of a function (Figure 1.8).\nFigure 1.8 (a) The set of plotted points represents the graph of\na function because every vertical line intersects the set of points,\nat most, once.

We make the idea of a function increasing or decreasing over a particular interval\nmore precise in the next definition.\nDefinition\nWe say that a function f is increasing on the interval I if for all x1, x2 ∈I,\nf(x1) ≤f(x2) when x1 < x2.\nWe say f is strictly increasing on the interval I if for all x1, x2 ∈I,\nChapter 1 | Functions and Graphs\n19\n\nf(x1) < f(x2) when x1 < x2.\nWe say that a function f is decreasing on the interval I if for all x1, x2 ∈I,\nf(x1) ≥f(x2) if x1 < x2.\nWe say that a function f is strictly decreasing on the interval I if for all x1, x2 ∈I,\nf(x1) > f(x2) if x1 < x2.\nFor example, the function f(x) = 3x is increasing on the interval (−∞, ∞) because 3x1 < 3x2 whenever x1 < x2.\nOn the other hand, the function f(x) = −x3 is decreasing on the interval (−∞, ∞) because −x1\n3 > −x2\n3 whenever\nx1 < x2 (Figure 1.11).\nFigure 1.11 (a) The function f(x) = 3x is increasing on the interval (−∞, ∞). (b) The\nfunction f(x) = −x3 is decreasing on the interval (−∞, ∞).\nCombining Functions\nNow that we have reviewed the basic characteristics of functions, we can see what happens to these properties when we\ncombine functions in different ways, using basic mathematical operations to create new functions. For example, if the cost\nfor a company to manufacture x items is described by the function C(x) and the revenue created by the sale of x items is\ndescribed by the function R(x), then the profit on the manufacture and sale of x items is defined as P(x) = R(x) −C(x).\nUsing the difference between two functions, we created a new function.\nAlternatively, we can create a new function by composing two functions. For example, given the functions f(x) = x2 and\ng(x) = 3x + 1,\nthe composite function f ∘g is defined such that\n⎛\n⎝f ∘g\n⎞\n⎠(x) = f\n⎛\n⎝g(x)\n⎞\n⎠=\n⎛\n⎝g(x)\n⎞\n⎠2 = (3x + 1)2.\n20\nChapter 1 | Functions and Graphs\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11964/1.12"}

Caroline has a coupon that entitles her to an additional\n15% off any item, including sale merchandise. If Caroline decides to purchase an item with an original price of\nx dollars, how much will she end up paying if she applies her coupon to the sale price? Solve this problem by\nusing a composite function.\nSolution\nSince the sale price is 20% off the original price, if an item is x dollars, its sale price is given by f(x) = 0.80x.\nSince the coupon entitles an individual to 15% off the price of any item, if an item is y dollars, the price, after\napplying the coupon, is given by g(y) = 0.85y. Therefore, if the price is originally x dollars, its sale price will\nbe f(x) = 0.80x and then its final price after the coupon will be g(f(x)) = 0.85(0.80x) = 0.68x.\nIf items are on sale for 10% off their original price, and a customer has a coupon for an additional 30%\noff, what will be the final price for an item that is originally x dollars, after applying the coupon to the sale\nprice?\nSymmetry of Functions\nThe graphs of certain functions have symmetry properties that help us understand the function and the shape of its graph.\nFor example, consider the function f(x) = x4 −2x2 −3 shown in Figure 1.13(a). If we take the part of the curve that\nlies to the right of the y-axis and flip it over the y-axis, it lays exactly on top of the curve to the left of the y-axis. In this\ncase, we say the function has symmetry about the y-axis. On the other hand, consider the function f(x) = x3 −4x shown\nin Figure 1.13(b). If we take the graph and rotate it 180° about the origin, the new graph will look exactly the same. In\nthis case, we say the function has symmetry about the origin.\nChapter 1 | Functions and Graphs\n25"}

Caroline has a coupon that entitles her to an additional\n15% off any item, including sale merchandise. If Caroline decides to purchase an item with an original price of\nx dollars, how much will she end up paying if she applies her coupon to the sale price? Solve this problem by\nusing a composite function.\nSolution\nSince the sale price is 20% off the original price, if an item is x dollars, its sale price is given by f(x) = 0.80x.\nSince the coupon entitles an individual to 15% off the price of any item, if an item is y dollars, the price, after\napplying the coupon, is given by g(y) = 0.85y. Therefore, if the price is originally x dollars, its sale price will\nbe f(x) = 0.80x and then its final price after the coupon will be g(f(x)) = 0.85(0.80x) = 0.68x.\nIf items are on sale for 10% off their original price, and a customer has a coupon for an additional 30%\noff, what will be the final price for an item that is originally x dollars, after applying the coupon to the sale\nprice?\nSymmetry of Functions\nThe graphs of certain functions have symmetry properties that help us understand the function and the shape of its graph.\nFor example, consider the function f(x) = x4 −2x2 −3 shown in Figure 1.13(a). If we take the part of the curve that\nlies to the right of the y-axis and flip it over the y-axis, it lays exactly on top of the curve to the left of the y-axis. In this\ncase, we say the function has symmetry about the y-axis. On the other hand, consider the function f(x) = x3 −4x shown\nin Figure 1.13(b). If we take the graph and rotate it 180° about the origin, the new graph will look exactly the same. In\nthis case, we say the function has symmetry about the origin.\nChapter 1 | Functions and Graphs\n25\n\nFigure 1.13 (a) A graph that is symmetric about the y -axis. (b) A graph that is symmetric\nabout the origin.\nIf we are given the graph of a function, it is easy to see whether the graph has one of these symmetry properties. But without\na graph, how can we determine algebraically whether a function f has symmetry? Looking at Figure 1.14 again, we see\nthat since f is symmetric about the y -axis, if the point (x, y) is on the graph, the point (−x, y) is on the graph. In other\nwords, f(−x) = f(x). If a function f has this property, we say f is an even function, which has symmetry about the\ny-axis. For example, f(x) = x2 is even because\nf(−x) = (−x)2 = x2 = f(x).\nIn contrast, looking at Figure 1.14 again, if a function f is symmetric about the origin, then whenever the point (x, y) is\non the graph, the point (−x, −y) is also on the graph. In other words, f(−x) = −f(x). If f has this property, we say f\nis an odd function, which has symmetry about the origin. For example, f(x) = x3 is odd because\nf(−x) = (−x)3 = −x3 = −f(x).\nDefinition\nIf f(x) = f(−x) for all x in the domain of f, then f is an even function. An even function is symmetric about the\ny-axis.\nIf f(−x) = −f(x) for all x in the domain of f, then f is an odd function. An odd function is symmetric about the\norigin.\nExample 1.10\nEven and Odd Functions\nDetermine whether each of the following functions is even, odd, or neither.\na.\nf(x) = −5x4 + 7x2 −2\n26\nChapter 1 | Functions and Graphs\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11964/1.12"}

Note that if\na > 0,\nthe graph of the line rises as x increases. In other words, f(x) = ax + b is increasing on (−∞, ∞). If a < 0,\nthe graph of the line falls as x increases.

One of the distinguishing features of a line is its\nslope. The slope is the change in y for each unit change in x. The slope measures both the steepness and the direction of\na line. If the slope is positive, the line points upward when moving from left to right. If the slope is negative, the line points\ndownward when moving from left to right. If the slope is zero, the line is horizontal. To calculate the slope of a line, we\nneed to determine the ratio of the change in y versus the change in x. To do so, we choose any two points (x1, y1) and\n(x2, y2) on the line and calculate y2 −y1\nx2 −x1.

Since we often use the symbol m to denote the slope of a line, we can write\nf(x) = mx + b\nto denote the slope-intercept form of a linear function.\nSometimes it is convenient to express a linear function in different ways.

A polynomial function is any function\nthat can be written in the form\n(1.7)\nf(x) = an xn + an −1 xn −1 + … + a1 x + a0\nfor some integer n ≥0 and constants an, an −1 ,…,a0, where an ≠0. In the case when n = 0, we allow for a0 = 0;\nif a0 = 0,\nthe function f(x) = 0 is called the zero function. The value n is called the degree of the polynomial; the\nconstant an is called the leading coefficient. A linear function of the form f(x) = mx + b is a polynomial of degree 1\nif m ≠0 and degree 0 if m = 0. A polynomial of degree 0 is also called a constant function. A polynomial function\nof degree 2 is called a quadratic function. In particular, a quadratic function has the form f(x) = ax2 + bx + c,\nwhere\na ≠0. A polynomial function of degree 3 is called a cubic function.\nPower Functions\nSome polynomial functions are power functions. A power function is any function of the form f(x) = axb, where a and\nb are any real numbers. The exponent in a power function can be any real number, but here we consider the case when the\nexponent is a positive integer. (We consider other cases later.) If the exponent is a positive integer, then f(x) = axn is a\npolynomial. If n is even, then f(x) = axn is an even function because f(−x) = a(−x)n = axn if n is even. If n is odd,\nthen f(x) = axn is an odd function because f(−x) = a(−x)n = −axn if n is odd (Figure 1.18).\n40\nChapter 1 | Functions and Graphs\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11964/1.12"}

A polynomial function is any function\nthat can be written in the form\n(1.7)\nf(x) = an xn + an −1 xn −1 + … + a1 x + a0\nfor some integer n ≥0 and constants an, an −1 ,…,a0, where an ≠0. In the case when n = 0, we allow for a0 = 0;\nif a0 = 0,\nthe function f(x) = 0 is called the zero function. The value n is called the degree of the polynomial; the\nconstant an is called the leading coefficient. A linear function of the form f(x) = mx + b is a polynomial of degree 1\nif m ≠0 and degree 0 if m = 0. A polynomial of degree 0 is also called a constant function. A polynomial function\nof degree 2 is called a quadratic function. In particular, a quadratic function has the form f(x) = ax2 + bx + c,\nwhere\na ≠0. A polynomial function of degree 3 is called a cubic function.\nPower Functions\nSome polynomial functions are power functions. A power function is any function of the form f(x) = axb, where a and\nb are any real numbers. The exponent in a power function can be any real number, but here we consider the case when the\nexponent is a positive integer. (We consider other cases later.) If the exponent is a positive integer, then f(x) = axn is a\npolynomial. If n is even, then f(x) = axn is an even function because f(−x) = a(−x)n = axn if n is even. If n is odd,\nthen f(x) = axn is an odd function because f(−x) = a(−x)n = −axn if n is odd (Figure 1.18).\n40\nChapter 1 | Functions and Graphs\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11964/1.12\n\nFigure 1.18 (a) For any even integer n, f(x) = axn is an even function. (b) For any odd\ninteger n, f(x) = axn is an odd function.\nBehavior at Infinity\nTo determine the behavior of a function f as the inputs approach infinity, we look at the values f(x) as the inputs,\nx,\nbecome larger. For some functions, the values of f(x) approach a finite number. For example, for the function\nf(x) = 2 + 1/x,\nthe values 1/x become closer and closer to zero for all values of x as they get larger and larger. For this\nfunction, we say “f(x) approaches two as x goes to infinity,” and we write f(x) →2 as x →∞. The line y = 2 is a\nhorizontal asymptote for the function f(x) = 2 + 1/x because the graph of the function gets closer to the line as x gets\nlarger.\nFor other functions, the values f(x) may not approach a finite number but instead may become larger for all values of x\nas they get larger. In that case, we say “f(x) approaches infinity as x approaches infinity,” and we write f(x) →∞as\nx →∞. For example, for the function f(x) = 3x2,\nthe outputs f(x) become larger as the inputs x get larger. We can\nconclude that the function f(x) = 3x2 approaches infinity as x approaches infinity, and we write 3x2 →∞as x →∞.\nThe behavior as x →−∞and the meaning of f(x) →−∞as x →∞or x →−∞can be defined similarly. We can\ndescribe what happens to the values of f(x) as x →∞and as x →−∞as the end behavior of the function.\nTo understand the end behavior for polynomial functions, we can focus on quadratic and cubic functions. The behavior for\nhigher-degree polynomials can be analyzed similarly. Consider a quadratic function f(x) = ax2 + bx + c. If a > 0,\nthe\nvalues f(x) →∞as x →±∞. If a < 0,\nthe values f(x) →−∞as x →±∞. Since the graph of a quadratic function\nis a parabola, the parabola opens upward if a > 0; the parabola opens downward if a < 0. (See Figure 1.19(a).)\nNow consider a cubic function f(x) = ax3 + bx2 + cx + d. If a > 0,\nthen f(x) →∞as x →∞and f(x) →−∞\nas x →−∞. If a < 0,\nthen f(x) →−∞as x →∞and f(x) →∞as x →−∞.

In particular, a rational\nfunction is any function of the form f(x) = p(x)/q(x),\nwhere p(x) and q(x) are polynomials. For example,\nf(x) = 3x −1\n5x + 2\nand\ng(x) =\n4\nx2 + 1\nare rational functions. A root function is a power function of the form f(x) = x1/n,\nwhere n is a positive integer greater\nthan one. For example, f(x) = x1/2 =\nx is the square-root function and g(x) = x1/3 =\nx\n3\nis the cube-root function. By\nallowing for compositions of root functions and rational functions, we can create other algebraic functions. For example,\nf(x) = 4 −x2 is an algebraic function.\nChapter 1 | Functions and Graphs\n47\n\nExample 1.16\nFinding Domain and Range for Algebraic Functions\nFor each of the following functions, find the domain and range.\na.\nf(x) = 3x −1\n5x + 2\nb.\nTo find the domain of f , we need 4 – x2 ≥0 . Or, 4 ≥x2 Or x2 ≤4 , the solution to which is\n– 2 ≤x ≤2 . Therefore, the domain is {x| – 2 ≤x ≤2} .

To\nfind the range, we need to find the values y for which there exists a real number x such that\ny = 3x −1\n5x + 2.\nWhen we multiply both sides of this equation by 5x + 2,\nwe see that x must satisfy the equation\n5xy + 2y = 3x −1.\nFrom this equation, we can see that x must satisfy\n2y + 1 = x(3 −5y).\nIf y = 3/5,\nthis equation has no solution. On the other hand, as long as y ≠3/5,\nx = 2y + 1\n3 −5y\nsatisfies this equation.

This inequality holds if and only if both terms are positive or both terms\nare negative. For both terms to be positive, we need to find x such that\n2 −x ≥0\nand\n2 + x ≥0.\nThese two inequalities reduce to 2 ≥x and x ≥−2. Therefore, the set {x| −2 ≤x ≤2} must be part\nof the domain.

(b) If 0 < c < 1,\nthe graph of y = cf(x) is a vertical compression of\nthe graph of y = f(x).\nThe horizontal scaling of a function occurs if we multiply the inputs x by the same positive constant. For c > 0,\nthe\ngraph of the function f(cx) is the graph of f(x) scaled horizontally by a factor of c. If c > 1, the graph of f(cx) is the\ngraph of f(x) compressed horizontally. If 0 < c < 1, the graph of f(cx) is the graph of f(x) stretched horizontally.

We have also discussed what happens to the graph of a function f when we multiply the independent\nvariable x by c > 0 to get a new function f(cx).

In other words, whatever a function does, the\ninverse function undoes it. In this section, we define an inverse function formally and state the necessary conditions for an\ninverse function to exist. We examine how to find an inverse function and study the relationship between the graph of a\nfunction and the graph of its inverse. Then we apply these ideas to define and discuss properties of the inverse trigonometric\nfunctions.\nExistence of an Inverse Function\nWe begin with an example. Given a function f\nand an output y = f(x),\nwe are often interested in finding what\nvalue or values x were mapped to y by f. For example, consider the function f(x) = x3 + 4. Since any output\ny = x3 + 4,\nwe can solve this equation for x to find that the input is x = y −4\n3\n. This equation defines x as a function\nof y. Denoting this function as f −1,\nand writing x = f −1(y) = y −4\n3\n,\nwe see that for any x in the domain of\nf, f −1 ⎛\n⎝f(x)\n⎞\n⎠= f −1 ⎛\n⎝x3 + 4⎞\n⎠= x.

In this section, we define an inverse function formally and state the necessary conditions for an\ninverse function to exist. We examine how to find an inverse function and study the relationship between the graph of a\nfunction and the graph of its inverse. Then we apply these ideas to define and discuss properties of the inverse trigonometric\nfunctions.\nExistence of an Inverse Function\nWe begin with an example. Given a function f\nand an output y = f(x),\nwe are often interested in finding what\nvalue or values x were mapped to y by f. For example, consider the function f(x) = x3 + 4. Since any output\ny = x3 + 4,\nwe can solve this equation for x to find that the input is x = y −4\n3\n. This equation defines x as a function\nof y.

For example, let’s try to find the inverse function for f(x) = x2. Solving the equation y = x2\nfor x,\nwe arrive at the equation x = ± y. This equation does not describe x as a function of y because there are two\nsolutions to this equation for every y > 0. The problem with trying to find an inverse function for f(x) = x2 is that two\ninputs are sent to the same output for each output y > 0. The function f(x) = x3 + 4 discussed earlier did not have this\nproblem. For that function, each input was sent to a different output. A function that sends each input to a different output\nis called a one-to-one function.\nDefinition\nWe say a f is a one-to-one function if f(x1) ≠f(x2) when x1 ≠x2.\nOne way to determine whether a function is one-to-one is by looking at its graph.

Consequently, this function is the inverse of f,\nand we write x = f −1(y).

For example, to evaluate cos−1 ⎛\n⎝1\n2\n⎞\n⎠, we need to\nfind an angle θ such that cosθ = 1\n2. Clearly, many angles have this property. However, given the definition of cos−1, we\nneed the angle θ that not only solves this equation, but also lies in the interval [0, π]. We conclude that cos−1 ⎛\n⎝1\n2\n⎞\n⎠= π\n3.\nWe now consider a composition of a trigonometric function and its inverse. For example, consider the two expressions\nsin⎛\n⎝sin−1 ⎛\n⎝2\n2\n⎞\n⎠\n⎞\n⎠and sin−1(sin(π)). For the first one, we simplify as follows:\nsin⎛\n⎝sin−1 ⎛\n⎝2\n2\n⎞\n⎠\n⎞\n⎠= sin⎛\n⎝π\n4\n⎞\n⎠=\n2\n2 .\nFor the second one, we have\nsin−1 ⎛\n⎝sin(π)\n⎞\n⎠= sin−1(0) = 0.\nThe inverse function is supposed to “undo” the original function, so why isn’t sin−1 ⎛\n⎝sin(π)\n⎞\n⎠= π? Recalling our definition\nof inverse functions, a function f and its inverse f −1 satisfy the conditions f ⎛\n⎝f −1(y)⎞\n⎠= y for all y in the domain of\nf −1 and f −1 ⎛\n⎝f(x)\n⎞\n⎠= x for all x in the domain of f, so what happened here? The issue is that the inverse sine function,\nsin−1,\nis the inverse of the restricted sine function defined on the domain ⎡\n⎣−π\n2, π\n2\n⎤\n⎦. Therefore, for x in the interval\n⎡\n⎣−π\n2, π\n2\n⎤\n⎦, it is true that sin−1(sinx) = x. However, for values of x outside this interval, the equation does not hold, even\nthough sin−1(sinx) is defined for all real numbers x.\nWhat about sin(sin−1 y)? Does that have a similar issue? The answer is no. Since the domain of sin−1 is the interval\n[−1, 1],\nwe conclude that sin(sin−1 y) = y if −1 ≤y ≤1 and the expression is not defined for other values of y.

Since A1 is 10 times the size of A2,\nwe say that the first\nearthquake is 10 times as intense as the second earthquake. On the other hand, if one earthquake measures 8 on\nthe Richter scale and another measures 6, then the relative intensity of the two earthquakes satisfies the equation\nlog10⎛\n⎝\nA1\nA2\n⎞\n⎠= 8 −6 = 2.\nTherefore, A1 = 100A2. That is, the first earthquake is 100 times more intense than the second earthquake.\nHow can we use logarithmic functions to compare the relative severity of the magnitude 9 earthquake in Japan in\n2011 with the magnitude 7.3 earthquake in Haiti in 2010?\nSolution\nTo compare the Japan and Haiti earthquakes, we can use an equation presented earlier:\n9 −7.3 = log10⎛\n⎝\nA1\nA2\n⎞\n⎠.\nTherefore, A1 /A2 = 101.7,\nand we conclude that the earthquake in Japan was approximately 50 times more\nintense than the earthquake in Haiti.\nCompare the relative severity of a magnitude 8.4 earthquake with a magnitude 7.4 earthquake.\nHyperbolic Functions\nThe hyperbolic functions are defined in terms of certain combinations of ex and e−x. These functions arise naturally\nin various engineering and physics applications, including the study of water waves and vibrations of elastic membranes.\nAnother common use for a hyperbolic function is the representation of a hanging chain or cable, also known as a catenary\n(Figure 1.49). If we introduce a coordinate system so that the low point of the chain lies along the y -axis, we can describe\nthe height of the chain in terms of a hyperbolic function. First, we define the hyperbolic functions.\nChapter 1 | Functions and Graphs\n107\n\nFigure 1.49 The shape of a strand of silk in a spider’s web\ncan be described in terms of a hyperbolic function.

Keeping in mind that velocity may be thought of as the rate\nof change of position, suppose that we have a function, s(t),\nthat gives the position of an object along a coordinate axis\nat any given time t. Can we use these same ideas to create a reasonable definition of the instantaneous velocity at a given\ntime t = a? We start by approximating the instantaneous velocity with an average velocity. First, recall that the speed of\nan object traveling at a constant rate is the ratio of the distance traveled to the length of time it has traveled. We define the\naverage velocity of an object over a time period to be the change in its position divided by the length of the time period.\nDefinition\nLet s(t) be the position of an object moving along a coordinate axis at time t.

We can think of the\nlimit of a function at a number a as being the one real number L that the functional values approach as the x-values approach\na, provided such a real number L exists. Stated more carefully, we have the following definition:\nDefinition\nLet f(x) be a function defined at all values in an open interval containing a, with the possible exception of a itself,\nand let L be a real number. If all values of the function f(x) approach the real number L as the values of x( ≠a)\napproach the number a, then we say that the limit of f(x) as x approaches a is L. (More succinct, as x gets closer to a,\nf(x) gets closer and stays close to L.) Symbolically, we express this idea as\n(2.3)\nlim\nx →af(x) = L.\nWe can estimate limits by constructing tables of functional values and by looking at their graphs. This process is described\nin the following Problem-Solving Strategy.\nProblem-Solving Strategy: Evaluating a Limit Using a Table of Functional Values\n1.\nTo evaluate\nlim\nx →af(x),\nwe begin by completing a table of functional values. We should choose two sets of\nx-values—one set of values approaching a and less than a, and another set of values approaching a and greater\nthan a. Table 2.1 demonstrates what your tables might look like.\nx\nf(x)\nx\nf(x)\na −0.1\nf(a −0.1)\na + 0.1\nf(a + 0.1)\na −0.01\nf(a −0.01)\na + 0.01\nf(a + 0.01)\na −0.001\nf(a −0.001)\na + 0.001\nf(a + 0.001)\na −0.0001\nf(a −0.0001)\na + 0.0001\nf(a + 0.0001)\nUse additional values as necessary.\nUse additional values as necessary.\nTable 2.1 Table of Functional Values for lim\nx →af(x)\n2.\nNext, let’s look at the values in each of the f(x) columns and determine whether the values seem to\nbe approaching a single value as we move down each column. In our columns, we look at the sequence\nf(a −0.1), f(a −0.01), f(a −0.001)., f(a −0.0001),\nand\nso\non,\nand\nf(a + 0.1), f(a + 0.01), f(a + 0.001), f(a + 0.0001),\nand so on.

Symbolically, we express this idea as\nlim\nx →2h(x) = +∞.\nMore generally, we define infinite limits as follows:\nDefinition\nWe define three types of infinite limits.\nInfinite limits from the left: Let f(x) be a function defined at all values in an open interval of the form (b, a).\ni.\nIf the values of f(x) increase without bound as the values of x (where x < a) approach the number a, then\nwe say that the limit as x approaches a from the left is positive infinity and we write\n(2.8)\nlim\nx →a−f(x) = +∞.\nii.\nIf the values of f(x) decrease without bound as the values of x (where x < a) approach the number a, then\nwe say that the limit as x approaches a from the left is negative infinity and we write\n(2.9)\nlim\nx →a−f(x) = −∞.\nInfinite limits from the right: Let f(x) be a function defined at all values in an open interval of the form (a, c).\ni.\nIf the values of f(x) increase without bound as the values of x (where x > a) approach the number a, then\nwe say that the limit as x approaches a from the right is positive infinity and we write\n(2.10)\nlim\nx →a+ f(x) = +∞.\nii.\nIf the values of f(x) decrease without bound as the values of x (where x > a) approach the number a, then\nwe say that the limit as x approaches a from the right is negative infinity and we write\n(2.11)\nlim\nx →a+ f(x) = −∞.\nTwo-sided infinite limit: Let f(x) be defined for all x ≠a in an open interval containing a.\ni.\nIf the values of f(x) increase without bound as the values of x (where x ≠a) approach the number a, then\nwe say that the limit as x approaches a is positive infinity and we write\n(2.12)\nlim\nx →af(x) = +∞.\nii.\nIf the values of f(x) decrease without bound as the values of x (where x ≠a) approach the number a, then\nwe say that the limit as x approaches a is negative infinity and we write\n(2.13)\nlim\nx →af(x) = −∞.\nIt is important to understand that when we write statements such as\nlim\nx →af(x) = +∞or\nlim\nx →af(x) = −∞we are\ndescribing the behavior of the function, as we have just defined it. We are not asserting that a limit exists. For the\nlimit of a function f(x) to exist at a, it must approach a real number L as x approaches a. That said, if, for example,\nlim\nx →af(x) = +∞,\nwe always write lim\nx →af(x) = +∞rather than lim\nx →af(x) DNE.\n146\nChapter 2 | Limits\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11964/1.12\n\nExample 2.9\nRecognizing an Infinite Limit\nEvaluate each of the following limits, if possible.

Intuitively, a removable discontinuity is a discontinuity for which there is a hole in the graph, a jump\ndiscontinuity is a noninfinite discontinuity for which the sections of the function do not meet up, and an infinite\ndiscontinuity is a discontinuity located at a vertical asymptote. Figure 2.37 illustrates the differences in these types of\ndiscontinuities.

We can obtain the slope of the secant by choosing a value of x near a and drawing a line\nthrough the points (a, f(a)) and\n⎛\n⎝x, f(x)\n⎞\n⎠,\nas shown in Figure 3.3. The slope of this line is given by an equation in the\nform of a difference quotient:\nmsec = f(x) −f(a)\nx −a\n.\nWe can also calculate the slope of a secant line to a function at a value a by using this equation and replacing x with\na + h,\nwhere h is a value close to 0. We can then calculate the slope of the line through the points (a, f(a)) and\n(a + h, f(a + h)). In this case, we find the secant line has a slope given by the following difference quotient with\nincrement h:\nmsec = f(a + h) −f(a)\na + h −a\n= f(a + h) −f(a)\nh\n.\nDefinition\nLet f be a function defined on an interval I containing a.

To find derivatives of polynomials and rational functions efficiently without resorting\nto the limit definition of the derivative, we must first develop formulas for differentiating these basic functions.\nThe Constant Rule\nWe first apply the limit definition of the derivative to find the derivative of the constant function, f(x) = c. For this\nfunction, both f(x) = c and f(x + h) = c,\nso we obtain the following result:\nf′(x) = lim\nh →0\nf(x + h) −f(x)\nh\n= lim\nh →0\nc −c\nh\n= lim\nh →0\n0\nh\n= lim\nh →00 = 0.\nThe rule for differentiating constant functions is called the constant rule. It states that the derivative of a constant function\nis zero; that is, since a constant function is a horizontal line, the slope, or the rate of change, of a constant function is 0. We\nrestate this rule in the following theorem.\nTheorem 3.2: The Constant Rule\nLet c be a constant.\nIf f(x) = c,\nthen f′(c) = 0.\nAlternatively, we may express this rule as\nd\ndx(c) = 0.\nExample 3.17\nChapter 3 | Derivatives\n247"}

If this is the case, we say that y is an explicit function of x. For example, when we write the equation y = x2 + 1,\nwe are defining y explicitly in terms of x. On the other hand, if the relationship between the function y and the variable x\nis expressed by an equation where y is not expressed entirely in terms of x,\nwe say that the equation defines y implicitly\nin terms of x. For example, the equation y −x2 = 1 defines the function y = x2 + 1 implicitly.\nImplicit differentiation allows us to find slopes of tangents to curves that are clearly not functions (they fail the vertical line\ntest). We are using the idea that portions of y are functions that satisfy the given equation, but that y is not actually a\nfunction of x.\nIn general, an equation defines a function implicitly if the function satisfies that equation.

The relationship we are studying is between the speed of the plane and the rate at which the distance\nbetween the plane and a person on the ground is changing.\nChapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives\n343\n\nExample 4.2\nAn Airplane Flying at a Constant Elevation\nAn airplane is flying overhead at a constant elevation of 4000 ft. A man is viewing the plane from a position\n3000 ft from the base of a radio tower. The airplane is flying horizontally away from the man. If the plane is\nflying at the rate of 600 ft/sec,\nat what rate is the distance between the man and the plane increasing when the\nplane passes over the radio tower?\nSolution\nStep 1. Draw a picture, introducing variables to represent the different quantities involved.\nFigure 4.3 An airplane is flying at a constant height of 4000 ft. The distance between the\nperson and the airplane and the person and the place on the ground directly below the airplane\nare changing. We denote those quantities with the variables s and x,\nrespectively.\nAs shown, x denotes the distance between the man and the position on the ground directly below the airplane.\nThe variable s denotes the distance between the man and the plane. Note that both x and s are functions of\ntime. We do not introduce a variable for the height of the plane because it remains at a constant elevation of\n4000 ft. Since an object’s height above the ground is measured as the shortest distance between the object and\nthe ground, the line segment of length 4000 ft is perpendicular to the line segment of length x feet, creating a\nright triangle.\nStep 2. Since x denotes the horizontal distance between the man and the point on the ground below the plane,\ndx/dt represents the speed of the plane. We are told the speed of the plane is 600 ft/sec. Therefore, dx\ndt = 600\nft/sec. Since we are asked to find the rate of change in the distance between the man and the plane when the plane\nis directly above the radio tower, we need to find ds/dt when x = 3000 ft.\nStep 3. From the figure, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to write an equation relating x and s:\n⎡\n⎣x(t)\n⎤\n⎦2 + 40002 =\n⎡\n⎣s(t)\n⎤\n⎦2.\nStep 4.

Since an object’s height above the ground is measured as the shortest distance between the object and\nthe ground, the line segment of length 4000 ft is perpendicular to the line segment of length x feet, creating a\nright triangle.\nStep 2. Since x denotes the horizontal distance between the man and the point on the ground below the plane,\ndx/dt represents the speed of the plane. We are told the speed of the plane is 600 ft/sec. Therefore, dx\ndt = 600\nft/sec. Since we are asked to find the rate of change in the distance between the man and the plane when the plane\nis directly above the radio tower, we need to find ds/dt when x = 3000 ft.\nStep 3. From the figure, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to write an equation relating x and s:\n⎡\n⎣x(t)\n⎤\n⎦2 + 40002 =\n⎡\n⎣s(t)\n⎤\n⎦2.\nStep 4. Differentiating this equation with respect to time and using the fact that the derivative of a constant is\nzero, we arrive at the equation\n344\nChapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11964/1.12\n\n4.2\nxdx\ndt = sds\ndt.\nStep 5. Find the rate at which the distance between the man and the plane is increasing when the plane is directly\nover the radio tower. That is, find ds\ndt when x = 3000 ft. Since the speed of the plane is 600 ft/sec,\nwe know\nthat dx\ndt = 600 ft/sec. We are not given an explicit value for s; however, since we are trying to find ds\ndt when\nx = 3000 ft,\nwe can use the Pythagorean theorem to determine the distance s when x = 3000 and the height\nis 4000 ft. Solving the equation\n30002 + 40002 = s2\nfor s,\nwe have s = 5000 ft at the time of interest. Using these values, we conclude that ds/dt is a solution of\nthe equation\n(3000)(600) = (5000) · ds\ndt.\nTherefore,\nds\ndt = 3000 · 600\n5000\n= 360 ft/sec.\nNote: When solving related-rates problems, it is important not to substitute values for the variables too soon. For\nexample, in step 3, we related the variable quantities x(t) and s(t) by the equation\n⎡\n⎣x(t)\n⎤\n⎦2 + 40002 =\n⎡\n⎣s(t)\n⎤\n⎦2.\nSince the plane remains at a constant height, it is not necessary to introduce a variable for the height, and we are\nallowed to use the constant 4000 to denote that quantity.

Note that for x near 2, the graph of\nthe tangent line is close to the graph of f. As a result, we can use the equation of the tangent line to approximate f(x) for\nx near 2. For example, if x = 2.1,\nthe y value of the corresponding point on the tangent line is\ny = 1\n2 −1\n4(2.1 −2) = 0.475.\nThe actual value of f(2.1) is given by\nf(2.1) = 1\n2.1 ≈0.47619.\nTherefore, the tangent line gives us a fairly good approximation of f(2.1) (Figure 4.7(b)).

For example, if x = 10,\nthe y\n-value of the corresponding point on the tangent line is\ny = 1\n2 −1\n4(10 −2) = 1\n2 −2 = −1.5,\nwhereas the value of the function at x = 10 is f(10) = 0.1.\n354\nChapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11964/1.12"}

{"page_number": "378-379", "content": "Note this theorem does not claim that a function f must have a local extremum at a critical point. Rather, it states that\ncritical points are candidates for local extrema. For example, consider the function f(x) = x3. We have f′(x) = 3x2 = 0\nwhen x = 0. Therefore, x = 0 is a critical point. However, f(x) = x3 is increasing over (−∞, ∞),\nand thus f does\nnot have a local extremum at x = 0. In Figure 4.15, we see several different possibilities for critical points. In some of\nthese cases, the functions have local extrema at critical points, whereas in other cases the functions do not. Note that these\ngraphs do not show all possibilities for the behavior of a function at a critical point.\nFigure 4.15 (a–e) A function f has a critical point at c if f′(c) = 0 or f′(c) is undefined.

This result may seem intuitively obvious, but it has important implications that are not obvious, and we discuss\nthem shortly.\nTheorem 4.6: Corollary 1: Functions with a Derivative of Zero\nLet f be differentiable over an interval I.

Therefore, f(x) = g(x) + C for all x ∈I.\n□\nThe third corollary of the Mean Value Theorem discusses when a function is increasing and when it is decreasing.

If, however, f does change\nconcavity at a point a and f is continuous at a,\nwe say the point\n⎛\n⎝a, f(a)\n⎞\n⎠is an inflection point of f.\nDefinition\nIf f is continuous at a and f changes concavity at a,\nthe point\n⎛\n⎝a, f(a)\n⎞\n⎠is an inflection point of f.\nFigure 4.35 Since f″(x) > 0 for x < a,\nthe function f is concave up over the interval\n(−∞, a). Since f″(x) < 0 for x > a,\nthe function f is concave down over the interval\n(a, ∞). The point\n⎛\n⎝a, f(a)\n⎞\n⎠is an inflection point of f.\nExample 4.19\nTesting for Concavity\nFor the function f(x) = x3 −6x2 + 9x + 30,\ndetermine all intervals where f is concave up and all intervals\nwhere f is concave down. List all inflection points for f. Use a graphing utility to confirm your results.\nSolution\nTo\ndetermine\nconcavity,\nwe\nneed\nto\nfind\nthe\nsecond\nderivative\nf″(x).\nThe\nfirst\nderivative\nis\nf′(x) = 3x2 −12x + 9,\nso the second derivative is f″(x) = 6x −12. If the function changes concavity, it\noccurs either when f″(x) = 0 or f″(x) is undefined. Since f″ is defined for all real numbers x, we need only\nfind where f″(x) = 0. Solving the equation 6x −12 = 0,\nwe see that x = 2 is the only place where f could\nchange concavity. We now test points over the intervals (−∞, 2) and (2, ∞) to determine the concavity of f.\nThe points x = 0 and x = 3 are test points for these intervals.\nChapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives\n397\n\n4.18\nInterval\nTest Point\nSign of f″(x) = 6x −12 at Test Point\nConclusion\n(−∞, 2)\nx = 0\n−\nf is concave down\n(2, ∞)\nx = 3\n+\nf is concave up.\nWe conclude that f is concave down over the interval (−∞, 2) and concave up over the interval (2, ∞).

Let f be a twice-differentiable function such that f′(a) = 0 and f″\nis continuous over an open interval I containing a. Suppose f″(a) < 0. Since f″ is continuous over I,\nf″(x) < 0 for\nall x ∈I (Figure 4.38). Then, by Corollary 3,\nf′ is a decreasing function over I. Since f′(a) = 0, we conclude that\nfor all x ∈I, f′(x) > 0 if x < a and f′(x) < 0 if x > a. Therefore, by the first derivative test, f has a local maximum\nat x = a. On the other hand, suppose there exists a point b such that f′(b) = 0 but f″(b) > 0. Since f″ is continuous\nover an open interval I containing b,\nthen f″(x) > 0 for all x ∈I (Figure 4.38).

Since f is a polynomial, the domain is the set of all real numbers.\nStep 2. When x = 0, f(x) = 2. Therefore, the y -intercept is (0, 2).

What is the maximum area?\nFigure 4.62 We want to determine the measurements x and\ny that will create a garden with a maximum area using 100 ft\nof fencing.\nSolution\nLet x denote the length of the side of the garden perpendicular to the rock wall and y denote the length of the\nside parallel to the rock wall. Then the area of the garden is\nA = x · y.\nChapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives\n439\n\nWe want to find the maximum possible area subject to the constraint that the total fencing is 100 ft. From Figure\n4.62, the total amount of fencing used will be 2x + y. Therefore, the constraint equation is\n2x + y = 100.\nSolving this equation for y,\nwe have y = 100 −2x. Thus, we can write the area as\nA(x) = x · (100 −2x) = 100x −2x2.\nBefore trying to maximize the area function A(x) = 100x −2x2,\nwe need to determine the domain under\nconsideration. To construct a rectangular garden, we certainly need the lengths of both sides to be positive.\nTherefore, we need x > 0 and y > 0. Since y = 100 −2x,\nif y > 0,\nthen x < 50. Therefore, we are trying\nto determine the maximum value of A(x) for x over the open interval (0, 50). We do not know that a function\nnecessarily has a maximum value over an open interval. However, we do know that a continuous function has\nan absolute maximum (and absolute minimum) over a closed interval. Therefore, let’s consider the function\nA(x) = 100x −2x2 over the closed interval\n⎡\n⎣0, 50\n⎤\n⎦. If the maximum value occurs at an interior point, then\nwe have found the value x in the open interval (0, 50) that maximizes the area of the garden. Therefore, we\nconsider the following problem:\nMaximize A(x) = 100x −2x2 over the interval\n⎡\n⎣0, 50\n⎤\n⎦.\nAs mentioned earlier, since A is a continuous function on a closed, bounded interval, by the extreme value\ntheorem, it has a maximum and a minimum. These extreme values occur either at endpoints or critical points. At\nthe endpoints, A(x) = 0. Since the area is positive for all x in the open interval (0, 50),\nthe maximum must\noccur at a critical point. Differentiating the function A(x),\nwe obtain\nA′(x) = 100 −4x.\nTherefore, the only critical point is x = 25 (Figure 4.63). We conclude that the maximum area must occur when\nx = 25. Then we have y = 100 −2x = 100 −2(25) = 50. To maximize the area of the garden, let x = 25 ft\nand y = 50 ft. The area of this garden is 1250 ft2.\nFigure 4.63 To maximize the area of the garden, we need to find the\nmaximum value of the function A(x) = 100x −2x2.\n440\nChapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11964/1.12"}

Therefore, the problem is to maximize V.\nStep 3: As mentioned in step 2,\nare trying to maximize the volume of a box. The volume of a box is\nV = L · W · H,\nwhere L, W, and H are the length, width, and height, respectively.\nStep 4: From Figure 4.64, we see that the height of the box is x inches, the length is 36 −2x inches, and the\nwidth is 24 −2x inches. Therefore, the volume of the box is\nV(x) = (36 −2x)(24 −2x)x = 4x3 −120x2 + 864x.\nStep 5: To determine the domain of consideration, let’s examine Figure 4.64. Certainly, we need x > 0.\nFurthermore, the side length of the square cannot be greater than or equal to half the length of the shorter side, 24\nin.; otherwise, one of the flaps would be completely cut off. Therefore, we are trying to determine whether there\nis a maximum volume of the box for x over the open interval (0, 12). Since V is a continuous function over\nthe closed interval [0, 12],\nwe know V will have an absolute maximum over the closed interval. Therefore,\nwe consider V over the closed interval [0, 12] and check whether the absolute maximum occurs at an interior\npoint.\nStep 6: Since V(x) is a continuous function over the closed, bounded interval [0, 12],\nV must have an absolute\nmaximum (and an absolute minimum). Since V(x) = 0 at the endpoints and V(x) > 0 for 0 < x < 12,\nthe\nmaximum must occur at a critical point.

Therefore, we need to minimize S.\nStep 3: Since the box has an open top, we need only determine the area of the four vertical sides and the base.\nThe area of each of the four vertical sides is x · y. The area of the base is x2. Therefore, the surface area of the\nbox is\nS = 4xy + x2.\nStep 4: Since the volume of this box is x2 y and the volume is given as 216 in.3,\nthe constraint equation is\nx2 y = 216.\nSolving the constraint equation for y,\nwe have y = 216\nx2 . Therefore, we can write the surface area as a function\nof x only:\nS(x) = 4x⎛\n⎝\n216\nx2\n⎞\n⎠+ x2.\nTherefore, S(x) = 864\nx\n+ x2.\nStep 5: Since we are requiring that x2 y = 216,\nwe cannot have x = 0. Therefore, we need x > 0. On the\nother hand, x is allowed to have any positive value. Note that as x becomes large, the height of the box\ny becomes correspondingly small so that x2 y = 216. Similarly, as x becomes small, the height of the box\nbecomes correspondingly large. We conclude that the domain is the open, unbounded interval (0, ∞).

This tool, known as L’Hôpital’s rule, uses derivatives to\ncalculate limits. With this rule, we will be able to evaluate many limits we have not yet been able to determine. Instead of\nrelying on numerical evidence to conjecture that a limit exists, we will be able to show definitively that a limit exists and to\ndetermine its exact value.\nApplying L’Hôpital’s Rule\nL’Hôpital’s rule can be used to evaluate limits involving the quotient of two functions. Consider\nlim\nx →a\nf(x)\ng(x).\nIf lim\nx →af(x) = L1 and lim\nx →ag(x) = L2 ≠0,\nthen\nlim\nx →a\nf(x)\ng(x) = L1\nL2\n.\nHowever, what happens if lim\nx →af(x) = 0 and lim\nx →ag(x) = 0? We call this one of the indeterminate forms, of type 0\n0.\nThis is considered an indeterminate form because we cannot determine the exact behavior of f(x)\ng(x) as x →a without\nfurther analysis. We have seen examples of this earlier in the text. For example, consider\nlim\nx →2\nx2 −4\nx −2 and lim\nx →0\nsinx\nx .\nFor the first of these examples, we can evaluate the limit by factoring the numerator and writing\nlim\nx →2\nx2 −4\nx −2 = lim\nx →2\n(x + 2)(x −2)\nx −2\n= lim\nx →2(x + 2) = 2 + 2 = 4.\nFor lim\nx →0\nsinx\nx\nwe were able to show, using a geometric argument, that\nlim\nx →0\nsinx\nx\n= 1.\nHere we use a different technique for evaluating limits such as these. Not only does this technique provide an easier way to\nevaluate these limits, but also, and more important, it provides us with a way to evaluate many other limits that we could\nnot calculate previously.\nThe idea behind L’Hôpital’s rule can be explained using local linear approximations. Consider two differentiable functions\nf and g such that lim\nx →af(x) = 0 = lim\nx →ag(x) and such that g′(a) ≠0 For x near a,\nwe can write\nf(x) ≈f(a) + f′(a)(x −a)\nand\ng(x) ≈g(a) + g′(a)(x −a).\nTherefore,\nf(x)\ng(x) ≈f(a) + f′(a)(x −a)\ng(a) + g′(a)(x −a).\n454\nChapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11964/1.12"}

Instead of\nrelying on numerical evidence to conjecture that a limit exists, we will be able to show definitively that a limit exists and to\ndetermine its exact value.\nApplying L’Hôpital’s Rule\nL’Hôpital’s rule can be used to evaluate limits involving the quotient of two functions. Consider\nlim\nx →a\nf(x)\ng(x).\nIf lim\nx →af(x) = L1 and lim\nx →ag(x) = L2 ≠0,\nthen\nlim\nx →a\nf(x)\ng(x) = L1\nL2\n.\nHowever, what happens if lim\nx →af(x) = 0 and lim\nx →ag(x) = 0? We call this one of the indeterminate forms, of type 0\n0.\nThis is considered an indeterminate form because we cannot determine the exact behavior of f(x)\ng(x) as x →a without\nfurther analysis. We have seen examples of this earlier in the text. For example, consider\nlim\nx →2\nx2 −4\nx −2 and lim\nx →0\nsinx\nx .\nFor the first of these examples, we can evaluate the limit by factoring the numerator and writing\nlim\nx →2\nx2 −4\nx −2 = lim\nx →2\n(x + 2)(x −2)\nx −2\n= lim\nx →2(x + 2) = 2 + 2 = 4.\nFor lim\nx →0\nsinx\nx\nwe were able to show, using a geometric argument, that\nlim\nx →0\nsinx\nx\n= 1.\nHere we use a different technique for evaluating limits such as these. Not only does this technique provide an easier way to\nevaluate these limits, but also, and more important, it provides us with a way to evaluate many other limits that we could\nnot calculate previously.\nThe idea behind L’Hôpital’s rule can be explained using local linear approximations. Consider two differentiable functions\nf and g such that lim\nx →af(x) = 0 = lim\nx →ag(x) and such that g′(a) ≠0 For x near a,\nwe can write\nf(x) ≈f(a) + f′(a)(x −a)\nand\ng(x) ≈g(a) + g′(a)(x −a).\nTherefore,\nf(x)\ng(x) ≈f(a) + f′(a)(x −a)\ng(a) + g′(a)(x −a).\n454\nChapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11964/1.12\n\nFigure 4.71 If lim\nx →af(x) = lim\nx →ag(x),\nthen the ratio f(x)/g(x) is\napproximately equal to the ratio of their linear approximations near a.\nSince\nf\nis differentiable at a,\nthen\nf\nis continuous at a,\nand therefore\nf(a) = lim\nx →af(x) = 0.\nSimilarly,\ng(a) = lim\nx →ag(x) = 0. If we also assume that f′ and g′ are continuous at x = a,\nthen f′(a) = lim\nx →af′(x) and\ng′(a) = lim\nx →ag′(x). Using these ideas, we conclude that\nlim\nx →a\nf(x)\ng(x) = lim\nx →a\nf′(x)(x −a)\ng′(x)(x −a) = lim\nx →a\nf′(x)\ng′(x).\nNote that the assumption that f′ and g′ are continuous at a and g′(a) ≠0 can be loosened. We state L’Hôpital’s rule\nformally for the indeterminate form 0\n0. Also note that the notation 0\n0 does not mean we are actually dividing zero by zero.\nRather, we are using the notation 0\n0 to represent a quotient of limits, each of which is zero.\nTheorem 4.12: L’Hôpital’s Rule (0/0 Case)\nSuppose\nf\nand g are differentiable functions over an open interval containing a,\nexcept possibly at a.

This result also holds if we are considering one-sided limits,\nor if a = ∞and −∞.\nProof\nWe provide a proof of this theorem in the special case when\nf, g, f′,\nand g′ are all continuous over an open\ninterval containing a. In that case, since\nlim\nx →af(x) = 0 = lim\nx →ag(x) and f and g are continuous at a,\nit follows that\nf(a) = 0 = g(a). Therefore,\nChapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives\n455"}

The key idea is that we must rewrite\nChapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives\n459\n\nthe indeterminate forms in such a way that we arrive at the indeterminate form 0\n0 or ∞/∞.\nIndeterminate Form of Type 0 · ∞\nSuppose we want to evaluate\nlim\nx →a\n⎛\n⎝f(x) · g(x)\n⎞\n⎠,\nwhere f(x) →0 and g(x) →∞(or −∞) as x →a. Since one term\nin the product is approaching zero but the other term is becoming arbitrarily large (in magnitude), anything can happen to\nthe product. We use the notation 0 · ∞to denote the form that arises in this situation. The expression 0 · ∞is considered\nindeterminate because we cannot determine without further analysis the exact behavior of the product f(x)g(x) as x →a.\nFor example, let n be a positive integer and consider\nf(x) =\n1\n(xn + 1) and g(x) = 3x2.\nAs x →∞,\nf(x) →0 and g(x) →∞. However, the limit as x →∞of f(x)g(x) =\n3x2\n(xn + 1) varies, depending on n.\nIf n = 2, then\nlim\nx →∞f(x)g(x) = 3. If n = 1, then\nlim\nx →∞f(x)g(x) = ∞. If n = 3, then\nlim\nx →∞f(x)g(x) = 0.

The car begins decelerating at a\nconstant rate of 15 ft/sec2.\na.\nHow many seconds elapse before the car stops?\nb.\nHow far does the car travel during that time?\nSolution\na.\nFirst we introduce variables for this problem. Let t be the time (in seconds) after the brakes are first\napplied. Let a(t) be the acceleration of the car (in feet per seconds squared) at time t. Let v(t) be the\nvelocity of the car (in feet per second) at time t. Let s(t) be the car’s position (in feet) beyond the point\nwhere the brakes are applied at time t.\nThe car is traveling at a rate of 88 ft/sec. Therefore, the initial velocity is v(0) = 88 ft/sec. Since the car\nis decelerating, the acceleration is\na(t) = −15 ft/s2.\nThe acceleration is the derivative of the velocity,\nv′(t) = −15.\nTherefore, we have an initial-value problem to solve:\nv′(t) = −15, v(0) = 88.\nIntegrating, we find that\nv(t) = −15t + C.\nSince v(0) = 88, C = 88. Thus, the velocity function is\nv(t) = −15t + 88.\nTo find how long it takes for the car to stop, we need to find the time t such that the velocity is zero.\nSolving −15t + 88 = 0,\nwe obtain t = 88\n15 sec.\nb.\nTo find how far the car travels during this time, we need to find the position of the car after 88\n15 sec. We\nknow the velocity v(t) is the derivative of the position s(t). Consider the initial position to be s(0) = 0.\nTherefore, we need to solve the initial-value problem\ns′(t) = −15t + 88, s(0) = 0.\nChapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives\n495"}
{"page_number": "503-504", "content": "We are interested in how long it takes for the car to stop. Recall that the velocity function v(t) is the derivative of a position\nfunction s(t),\nand the acceleration a(t) is the derivative of the velocity function. In earlier examples in the text, we could\ncalculate the velocity from the position and then compute the acceleration from the velocity. In the next example we work\nthe other way around.

In this process, an area bounded by curves is filled with rectangles, triangles, and shapes with exact area\nformulas. These areas are then summed to approximate the area of the curved region.\nIn this section, we develop techniques to approximate the area between a curve, defined by a function f(x), and the x-axis\non a closed interval\n⎡\n⎣a, b\n⎤\n⎦.

We begin\nby dividing the interval\n⎡\n⎣a, b\n⎤\n⎦into n subintervals of equal width, b −a\nn\n. We do this by selecting equally spaced points\nx0, x1, x2 ,…, xn with x0 = a, xn = b,\nand\nxi −xi −1 = b −a\nn\nfor i = 1, 2, 3,…, n.\nWe denote the width of each subinterval with the notation Δx, so Δx = b −a\nn\nand\nxi = x0 + iΔx\nfor i = 1, 2, 3,…, n. This notion of dividing an interval\n⎡\n⎣a, b\n⎤\n⎦into subintervals by selecting points from within the interval\nis used quite often in approximating the area under a curve, so let’s define some relevant terminology.\nDefinition\nA set of points P = {xi} for i = 0, 1, 2,…, n with a = x0 < x1 < x2 < ⋯< xn = b,\nwhich divides the interval\n⎡\n⎣a, b\n⎤\n⎦into subintervals of the form [x0, x1], [x1, x2],…, [xn −1, xn] is called a partition of\n⎡\n⎣a, b\n⎤\n⎦. If the\nsubintervals all have the same width, the set of points forms a regular partition of the interval\n⎡\n⎣a, b\n⎤\n⎦.\n512\nChapter 5 | Integration\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11964/1.12\n\nWe can use this regular partition as the basis of a method for estimating the area under the curve.

For\nexample, functions with a finite number of jump discontinuities on a closed interval are integrable.\nIt is also worth noting here that we have retained the use of a regular partition in the Riemann sums. This restriction is not\nstrictly necessary. Any partition can be used to form a Riemann sum. However, if a nonregular partition is used to define\nthe definite integral, it is not sufficient to take the limit as the number of subintervals goes to infinity. Instead, we must take\nthe limit as the width of the largest subinterval goes to zero. This introduces a little more complex notation in our limits and\nmakes the calculations more difficult without really gaining much additional insight, so we stick with regular partitions for\nthe Riemann sums.\nExample 5.7\nEvaluating an Integral Using the Definition\nUse the definition of the definite integral to evaluate ∫\n0\n2\nx2 dx. Use a right-endpoint approximation to generate\nthe Riemann sum.\nSolution\nWe first want to set up a Riemann sum. Based on the limits of integration, we have a = 0 and b = 2. For\ni = 0, 1, 2,…, n,\nlet P = {xi} be a regular partition of [0, 2]. Then\nΔx = b −a\nn\n= 2n.\nSince we are using a right-endpoint approximation to generate Riemann sums, for each i, we need to calculate\nthe function value at the right endpoint of the interval [xi −1, xi]. The right endpoint of the interval is xi,\nand\nsince P is a regular partition,\nxi = x0 + iΔx = 0 + i⎡\n⎣2n\n⎤\n⎦= 2in .\nThus, the function value at the right endpoint of the interval is\nf(xi) = xi\n2 = ⎛\n⎝2in\n⎞\n⎠\n2\n= 4i2\nn2 .\nThen the Riemann sum takes the form\n∑\ni = 1\nn\nf(xi)Δx = ∑\ni = 1\nn ⎛\n⎝\n4i2\nn2\n⎞\n⎠\n2n = ∑\ni = 1\nn\n8i2\nn3 = 8\nn3 ∑\ni = 1\nn\ni2.\nUsing the summation formula for ∑\ni = 1\nn\ni2,\nwe have\n530\nChapter 5 | Integration\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11964/1.12"}

However, if a nonregular partition is used to define\nthe definite integral, it is not sufficient to take the limit as the number of subintervals goes to infinity. Instead, we must take\nthe limit as the width of the largest subinterval goes to zero. This introduces a little more complex notation in our limits and\nmakes the calculations more difficult without really gaining much additional insight, so we stick with regular partitions for\nthe Riemann sums.\nExample 5.7\nEvaluating an Integral Using the Definition\nUse the definition of the definite integral to evaluate ∫\n0\n2\nx2 dx. Use a right-endpoint approximation to generate\nthe Riemann sum.\nSolution\nWe first want to set up a Riemann sum. Based on the limits of integration, we have a = 0 and b = 2. For\ni = 0, 1, 2,…, n,\nlet P = {xi} be a regular partition of [0, 2]. Then\nΔx = b −a\nn\n= 2n.\nSince we are using a right-endpoint approximation to generate Riemann sums, for each i, we need to calculate\nthe function value at the right endpoint of the interval [xi −1, xi]. The right endpoint of the interval is xi,\nand\nsince P is a regular partition,\nxi = x0 + iΔx = 0 + i⎡\n⎣2n\n⎤\n⎦= 2in .\nThus, the function value at the right endpoint of the interval is\nf(xi) = xi\n2 = ⎛\n⎝2in\n⎞\n⎠\n2\n= 4i2\nn2 .\nThen the Riemann sum takes the form\n∑\ni = 1\nn\nf(xi)Δx = ∑\ni = 1\nn ⎛\n⎝\n4i2\nn2\n⎞\n⎠\n2n = ∑\ni = 1\nn\n8i2\nn3 = 8\nn3 ∑\ni = 1\nn\ni2.\nUsing the summation formula for ∑\ni = 1\nn\ni2,\nwe have\n530\nChapter 5 | Integration\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11964/1.12\n\n5.7\n∑\ni = 1\nn\nf(xi)Δx = 8\nn3 ∑\ni = 1\nn\ni2\n= 8\nn3\n⎡\n⎣\nn(n + 1)(2n + 1)\n6\n⎤\n⎦\n= 8\nn3\n⎡\n⎣\n2n3 + 3n2 + n\n6\n⎤\n⎦\n= 16n3 + 24n2 + 8n\n6n3\n= 8\n3 + 4n + 8\n6n2.\nNow, to calculate the definite integral, we need to take the limit as n →∞.

Although definite and indefinite integrals\nare closely related, there are some key differences to keep in mind. A definite integral is either a number (when the limits\nof integration are constants) or a single function (when one or both of the limits of integration are variables). An indefinite\nintegral represents a family of functions, all of which differ by a constant. As you become more familiar with integration,\nyou will get a feel for when to use definite integrals and when to use indefinite integrals. You will naturally select the correct\napproach for a given problem without thinking too much about it. However, until these concepts are cemented in your mind,\nthink carefully about whether you need a definite integral or an indefinite integral and make sure you are using the proper\nnotation based on your choice.\nBasic Integration Formulas\nRecall the integration formulas given in the table in Antiderivatives and the rule on properties of definite integrals.

A definite integral is either a number (when the limits\nof integration are constants) or a single function (when one or both of the limits of integration are variables). An indefinite\nintegral represents a family of functions, all of which differ by a constant. As you become more familiar with integration,\nyou will get a feel for when to use definite integrals and when to use indefinite integrals. You will naturally select the correct\napproach for a given problem without thinking too much about it. However, until these concepts are cemented in your mind,\nthink carefully about whether you need a definite integral or an indefinite integral and make sure you are using the proper\nnotation based on your choice.\nBasic Integration Formulas\nRecall the integration formulas given in the table in Antiderivatives and the rule on properties of definite integrals. Let’s\nlook at a few examples of how to apply these rules.\nExample 5.23\nIntegrating a Function Using the Power Rule\nUse the power rule to integrate the function ∫\n1\n4\nt(1 + t)dt.\nSolution\nThe first step is to rewrite the function and simplify it so we can apply the power rule:\n∫\n1\n4\nt(1 + t)dt = ∫\n1\n4\nt1/2(1 + t)dt\n= ∫\n1\n4⎛\n⎝t1/2 + t3/2⎞\n⎠dt.\nNow apply the power rule:\n∫\n1\n4⎛\n⎝t1/2 + t3/2⎞\n⎠dt = ⎛\n⎝2\n3t3/2 + 2\n5t5/2⎞\n⎠|1\n4\n= ⎡\n⎣2\n3(4)3/2 + 2\n5(4)5/2⎤\n⎦−⎡\n⎣2\n3(1)3/2 + 2\n5(1)5/2⎤\n⎦\n= 256\n15 .\nFind the definite integral of f(x) = x2 −3x over the interval [1, 3].\n566\nChapter 5 | Integration\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11964/1.12\n\nThe Net Change Theorem\nThe net change theorem considers the integral of a rate of change. It says that when a quantity changes, the new value\nequals the initial value plus the integral of the rate of change of that quantity. The formula can be expressed in two ways.\nThe second is more familiar; it is simply the definite integral.\nTheorem 5.6: Net Change Theorem\nThe new value of a changing quantity equals the initial value plus the integral of the rate of change:\n(5.18)\nF(b) = F(a) + ∫\na\nb\nF'(x)dx\nor\n∫\na\nb\nF'(x)dx = F(b) −F(a).\nSubtracting F(a) from both sides of the first equation yields the second equation.

Net change can be applied to area, distance, and volume, to\nname only a few applications. Net change accounts for negative quantities automatically without having to write more than\none integral. To illustrate, let’s apply the net change theorem to a velocity function in which the result is displacement.\nWe looked at a simple example of this in The Definite Integral.

Let’s\nlook at an example in which integration of an exponential function solves a common business application.\nA price–demand function tells us the relationship between the quantity of a product demanded and the price of the product.\nIn general, price decreases as quantity demanded increases. The marginal price–demand function is the derivative of the\nprice–demand function and it tells us how fast the price changes at a given level of production. These functions are used in\nbusiness to determine the price–elasticity of demand, and to help companies determine whether changing production levels\nwould be profitable.\nExample 5.40\nFinding a Price–Demand Equation\nFind the price–demand equation for a particular brand of toothpaste at a supermarket chain when the demand is\n50 tubes per week at $2.35 per tube, given that the marginal price—demand function, p′(x),\nfor x number of\ntubes per week, is given as\np'(x) = −0.015e−0.01x.\nIf the supermarket chain sells 100 tubes per week, what price should it set?\nSolution\nTo find the price–demand equation, integrate the marginal price–demand function.

In this section, we use definite\nintegrals to find volumes of three-dimensional solids. We consider three approaches—slicing, disks, and washers—for\nfinding these volumes, depending on the characteristics of the solid.\nVolume and the Slicing Method\nJust as area is the numerical measure of a two-dimensional region, volume is the numerical measure of a three-dimensional\nsolid. Most of us have computed volumes of solids by using basic geometric formulas. The volume of a rectangular solid,\nfor example, can be computed by multiplying length, width, and height: V = lwh. The formulas for the volume of a sphere\n⎛\n⎝V = 4\n3πr3⎞\n⎠,\na cone ⎛\n⎝V = 1\n3πr2 h⎞\n⎠,\nand a pyramid ⎛\n⎝V = 1\n3Ah⎞\n⎠have also been introduced. Although some of these\nformulas were derived using geometry alone, all these formulas can be obtained by using integration.\nWe can also calculate the volume of a cylinder. Although most of us think of a cylinder as having a circular base, such as\na soup can or a metal rod, in mathematics the word cylinder has a more general meaning. To discuss cylinders in this more\ngeneral context, we first need to define some vocabulary.\nWe define the cross-section of a solid to be the intersection of a plane with the solid. A cylinder is defined as any solid\nthat can be generated by translating a plane region along a line perpendicular to the region, called the axis of the cylinder.\nThus, all cross-sections perpendicular to the axis of a cylinder are identical. The solid shown in Figure 6.11 is an example\nof a cylinder with a noncircular base. To calculate the volume of a cylinder, then, we simply multiply the area of the cross-\nsection by the height of the cylinder: V = A · h. In the case of a right circular cylinder (soup can), this becomes V = πr2 h.\nFigure 6.11 Each cross-section of a particular cylinder is identical to the others.\nIf a solid does not have a constant cross-section (and it is not one of the other basic solids), we may not have a formula for\nits volume. In this case, we can use a definite integral to calculate the volume of the solid. We do this by slicing the solid\ninto pieces, estimating the volume of each slice, and then adding those estimated volumes together. The slices should all be\nparallel to one another, and when we put all the slices together, we should get the whole solid. Consider, for example, the\nsolid S shown in Figure 6.12, extending along the x-axis.\n636\nChapter 6 | Applications of Integration\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11964/1.12"}

To set this up, we need to revisit the development of the method of cylindrical shells. Recall\nthat we found the volume of one of the shells to be given by\nVshell = f(xi* )(πxi\n2 −πxi −1\n2\n)\n= π f(xi* )⎛\n⎝xi\n2 −xi −1\n2\n⎞\n⎠\n= π f(xi* )(xi + xi −1)(xi −xi −1)\n= 2π f(xi* )⎛\n⎝\nxi + xi −1\n2\n⎞\n⎠(xi −xi −1).\nThis was based on a shell with an outer radius of xi and an inner radius of xi −1. If, however, we rotate the region around\na line other than the y-axis,\nwe have a different outer and inner radius. Suppose, for example, that we rotate the region\naround the line x = −k,\nwhere k is some positive constant. Then, the outer radius of the shell is xi + k and the inner\nradius of the shell is xi −1 + k. Substituting these terms into the expression for volume, we see that when a plane region is\nrotated around the line x = −k,\nthe volume of a shell is given by\nVshell = 2π f(xi* )⎛\n⎝\n⎛\n⎝xi + k⎞\n⎠+ ⎛\n⎝xi −1 + k⎞\n⎠\n2\n⎞\n⎠\n⎛\n⎝\n⎛\n⎝xi + k⎞\n⎠−⎛\n⎝xi −1 + k⎞\n⎠\n⎞\n⎠\n= 2π f(xi* )⎛\n⎝\n⎛\n⎝\nxi + xi −2\n2\n⎞\n⎠+ k⎞\n⎠Δx.\nAs before, we notice that xi + xi −1\n2\nis the midpoint of the interval [xi −1, xi] and can be approximated by xi* . Then,\nthe approximate volume of the shell is\nVshell ≈2π⎛\n⎝xi* + k⎞\n⎠f(xi* )Δx.\nThe remainder of the development proceeds as before, and we see that\nV = ∫\na\nb\n⎛\n⎝2π(x + k)f(x)\n⎞\n⎠dx.\nWe could also rotate the region around other horizontal or vertical lines, such as a vertical line in the right half plane. In\neach case, the volume formula must be adjusted accordingly. Specifically, the x-term in the integral must be replaced with\nan expression representing the radius of a shell. To see how this works, consider the following example.\nExample 6.15\nA Region of Revolution Revolved around a Line\nDefine R as the region bounded above by the graph of f(x) = x and below by the x-axis over the interval\n[1, 2].

We can think of arc length as the distance you\nwould travel if you were walking along the path of the curve. Many real-world applications involve arc length. If a rocket\nis launched along a parabolic path, we might want to know how far the rocket travels. Or, if a curve on a map represents a\nroad, we might want to know how far we have to drive to reach our destination.\nWe begin by calculating the arc length of curves defined as functions of x,\nthen we examine the same process for curves\ndefined as functions of y. (The process is identical, with the roles of x and y reversed.) The techniques we use to find arc\nlength can be extended to find the surface area of a surface of revolution, and we close the section with an examination of\nthis concept.\nArc Length of the Curve y = f(x)\nIn previous applications of integration, we required the function f(x) to be integrable, or at most continuous. However,\nfor calculating arc length we have a more stringent requirement for f(x). Here, we require f(x) to be differentiable, and\nfurthermore we require its derivative, f′(x),\nto be continuous. Functions like this, which have continuous derivatives, are\ncalled smooth. (This property comes up again in later chapters.)\nLet f(x) be a smooth function defined over\n⎡\n⎣a, b\n⎤\n⎦. We want to calculate the length of the curve from the point\n⎛\n⎝a, f(a)\n⎞\n⎠\nto the point\n⎛\n⎝b, f(b)\n⎞\n⎠. We start by using line segments to approximate the length of the curve.

Because we have used a regular partition, the change in horizontal distance over each interval is\ngiven by Δx. The change in vertical distance varies from interval to interval, though, so we use Δyi = f(xi) −f(xi −1)\nto represent the change in vertical distance over the interval [xi −1, xi],\nas shown in Figure 6.38.

In the English system, force\nis measured in pounds. In the metric system, it is measured in newtons. Pressure is force per unit area, so in the English\nsystem we have pounds per square foot (or, perhaps more commonly, pounds per square inch, denoted psi). In the metric\nsystem we have newtons per square meter, also called pascals.\nLet’s begin with the simple case of a plate of area A submerged horizontally in water at a depth s (Figure 6.56). Then, the\nforce exerted on the plate is simply the weight of the water above it, which is given by F = ρAs,\nwhere ρ is the weight\ndensity of water (weight per unit volume). To find the hydrostatic pressure—that is, the pressure exerted by water on a\nsubmerged object—we divide the force by the area. So the pressure is p = F/A = ρs.\nFigure 6.56 A plate submerged horizontally in water.\nBy Pascal’s principle, the pressure at a given depth is the same in all directions, so it does not matter if the plate is submerged\nhorizontally or vertically. So, as long as we know the depth, we know the pressure. We can apply Pascal’s principle to find\nthe force exerted on surfaces, such as dams, that are oriented vertically. We cannot apply the formula F = ρAs directly,\nbecause the depth varies from point to point on a vertically oriented surface. So, as we have done many times before, we\nform a partition, a Riemann sum, and, ultimately, a definite integral to calculate the force.\nSuppose a thin plate is submerged in water. We choose our frame of reference such that the x-axis is oriented vertically, with\nthe downward direction being positive, and point x = 0 corresponding to a logical reference point. Let s(x) denote the\ndepth at point x. Note we often let x = 0 correspond to the surface of the water. In this case, depth at any point is simply\ngiven by s(x) = x.

The basic idea\nof the center of mass is the notion of a balancing point. Many of us have seen performers who spin plates on the ends of\nsticks. The performers try to keep several of them spinning without allowing any of them to drop. If we look at a single plate\n(without spinning it), there is a sweet spot on the plate where it balances perfectly on the stick. If we put the stick anywhere\nother than that sweet spot, the plate does not balance and it falls to the ground. (That is why performers spin the plates; the\nspin helps keep the plates from falling even if the stick is not exactly in the right place.) Mathematically, that sweet spot is\ncalled the center of mass of the plate.\nIn this section, we first examine these concepts in a one-dimensional context, then expand our development to consider\ncenters of mass of two-dimensional regions and symmetry. Last, we use centroids to find the volume of certain solids by\napplying the theorem of Pappus.\nCenter of Mass and Moments\nLet’s begin by looking at the center of mass in a one-dimensional context. Consider a long, thin wire or rod of negligible\nmass resting on a fulcrum, as shown in Figure 6.62(a). Now suppose we place objects having masses m1 and m2 at\ndistances d1 and d2 from the fulcrum, respectively, as shown in Figure 6.62(b).\nFigure 6.62 (a) A thin rod rests on a fulcrum. (b) Masses are\nplaced on the rod.\nThe most common real-life example of a system like this is a playground seesaw, or teeter-totter, with children of different\nweights sitting at different distances from the center. On a seesaw, if one child sits at each end, the heavier child sinks\ndown and the lighter child is lifted into the air. If the heavier child slides in toward the center, though, the seesaw balances.\nApplying this concept to the masses on the rod, we note that the masses balance each other if and only if m1 d1 = m2 d2.\nIn the seesaw example, we balanced the system by moving the masses (children) with respect to the fulcrum. However,\nwe are really interested in systems in which the masses are not allowed to move, and instead we balance the system by\nmoving the fulcrum. Suppose we have two point masses, m1 and m2,\nlocated on a number line at points x1 and x2,\nrespectively (Figure 6.63).

Now, instead of having the mass of a system\nconcentrated at discrete points, we want to look at systems in which the mass of the system is distributed continuously\nacross a thin sheet of material. For our purposes, we assume the sheet is thin enough that it can be treated as if it is two-\ndimensional. Such a sheet is called a lamina. Next we develop techniques to find the center of mass of a lamina. In this\nsection, we also assume the density of the lamina is constant.\nLaminas are often represented by a two-dimensional region in a plane. The geometric center of such a region is called its\ncentroid. Since we have assumed the density of the lamina is constant, the center of mass of the lamina depends only on\nthe shape of the corresponding region in the plane; it does not depend on the density. In this case, the center of mass of the\nlamina corresponds to the centroid of the delineated region in the plane. As with systems of point masses, we need to find\nthe total mass of the lamina, as well as the moments of the lamina with respect to the x- and y-axes.\nWe first consider a lamina in the shape of a rectangle. Recall that the center of mass of a lamina is the point where the lamina\nbalances. For a rectangle, that point is both the horizontal and vertical center of the rectangle.

Consider a population of bacteria, for instance. It seems\nplausible that the rate of population growth would be proportional to the size of the population. After all, the more bacteria\nthere are to reproduce, the faster the population grows.

Interest that is not compounded is called simple\ninterest. Simple interest is paid once, at the end of the specified time period (usually 1 year).

Therefore, if the bank\ncompounds the interest every 6 months, it credits half of the year’s interest to the account after 6 months.
