{"question": "What is the first derivative of 1028 - 597*a wrt a?", "gold_answer": "-597", "model_answer": "To find the first derivative of the function \\(1028 - 597a\\) with respect to \\(a\\), we need to apply basic rules of differentiation. Differentiation is a key concept in calculus used to find the rate at which a quantity changes.\n\nGiven the function \\(f(a) = 1028 - 597a\\), we want to differentiate this function with respect to \\(a\\).\n\n1. **Constant Rule**: The derivative of a constant is zero. In the expression \\(1028\\), \\(1028\\) is a constant. Therefore, the derivative of \\(1028\\) with respect to \\(a\\) is \\(0\\).\n\n2. **Coefficient Rule**: If you have a term that is a constant multiplied by a variable, its derivative is simply the constant. The term \\(-597a\\) has \\(-597\\) as a constant multiplied by the variable \\(a\\). The derivative of \\(a\\) with respect to \\(a\\) is \\(1\\). Therefore, the derivative of \\(-597a\\) is \\(-597 \\times 1 = -597\\).\n\nPutting it all together, the derivative of the function \\(1028 - 597a\\) with respect to \\(a\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{da}(1028 - 597a) = 0 - 597 = -597\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the first derivative of the function with respect to \\(a\\) is \\(-597\\). This indicates that for every unit increase in \\(a\\), the function \\(f(a)\\) decreases by 597 units, which is consistent with the interpretation of the derivative as the rate of change.", "evaluation": "correct"}

The derivative represents the rate at which a function is changing at any given point and is a foundational concept in calculus.\n\n2. **Power Rule**: A primary rule for differentiation is the power rule. The power rule states that if you have a term in the form of \\(as^n\\), where \\(a\\) is a constant and \\(s\\) is the variable, the derivative of this term with respect to \\(s\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{ds}(as^n) = nas^{n-1}\n   \\]\n   In this expression, \\(n\\) is the exponent of the variable \\(s\\).\n\n3. **Constant Rule**: Another important rule is that the derivative of a constant is zero. If you take the derivative of a constant \\(c\\), the result is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{ds}(c) = 0\n   \\]\n\n4. **Applying Differentiation to Each Term**: Let’s apply these rules to the expression \\(-321s^2 - 414\\):\n\n   - For the first term \\(-321s^2\\):\n     - Identify \\(a = -321\\) and \\(n = 2\\).\n     - Using the power rule: \\(\\frac{d}{ds}(-321s^2) = -321 \\times 2 \\times s^{2-1} = -642s\\).\n\n   - For the second term \\(-414\\):\n     - This is a constant, so by the constant rule: \\(\\frac{d}{ds}(-414) = 0\\).\n\n5. **Combine the Derivatives**: Now combine the derivatives of both terms to get the derivative of the whole function:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{ds}(-321s^2 - 414) = -642s + 0 = -642s\n   \\]\n\nSo, the first derivative of the given expression \\(-321s^2 - 414\\) with respect to \\(s\\) is \\(-642s\\).

{"question": "What is the second derivative of 6436*n**4 - 4884*n?", "gold_answer": "77232*n**2", "model_answer": "To find the second derivative of the function \\( f(n) = 6436n^4 - 4884n \\), we first need to understand the process of differentiation. Differentiation is the mathematical process of finding the derivative of a function, which represents the rate at which the function's value changes with respect to changes in the input value.\n\n1. **First Derivative**: Start by finding the first derivative of the function. The derivative of a term of the form \\( an^m \\) is given by applying the power rule: \n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dn}(n^m) = m \\cdot n^{m-1}\n   \\]\n\n   Applying this to each term in the function:\n\n   - For \\( 6436n^4 \\), the derivative is \\( 4 \\cdot 6436 \\cdot n^{3} = 25744n^3 \\).\n   - For \\( -4884n \\), the derivative is \\( 1 \\cdot (-4884) \\cdot n^{1-1} = -4884 \\).\n\n   Therefore, the first derivative \\( f'(n) \\) is:\n\n   \\[\n   f'(n) = 25744n^3 - 4884\n   \\]\n\n2. **Second Derivative**: Now, differentiate the first derivative to find the second derivative. Again, apply the power rule to each term:\n\n   - For \\( 25744n^3 \\), the derivative is \\( 3 \\cdot 25744 \\cdot n^{2} = 77232n^2 \\).\n   - The derivative of a constant, like \\(-4884\\), is \\(0\\).\n\n   Therefore, the second derivative \\( f''(n) \\) is:\n\n   \\[\n   f''(n) = 77232n^2\n   \\]\n\nSo, the second derivative of the given function \\( 6436n^4 - 4884n \\) is \\( 77232n^2 \\). This derivative tells us about the concavity of the function, indicating how the rate of change of the function's slope is itself changing.", "evaluation": "correct"}
